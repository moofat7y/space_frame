      "title": "what is a Space Frame?",
      "description": "While technically any 3D structure could be called a space frame, in structural engineering it has a more specific meaning.  A space frame is a structure built from interlocking linear elements that can transfer forces in all three dimesions (think X, Y, and Z axes).",
      "aboutSpaceFrame": "About SpaceFrame Company",
      "aboutDetails": "SpaceFrame company specializes in long-span, column-Free space frame structure for industrial and architectural applications, we execute space frame system with Its bars and nodes, not only distributed loads more efficiently but also provides an elegant interior that can span up to 100 m in flat shape and more than in a curved shape By using the advantages of space frame, we are making architect's imagination true.",
      "aboutList": {
        "1": "Our projects include schools, sports halls, swimming pools, public buildings, transportation structures, museums, corporate office buildings, all buildings needs to be column free with wide spans and beyond.",
        "2": "We design, fabricate and erect ourselves. Structures are 100% prefabricated, with easy assembled mechanical connections.",
        "3": "The Connection between tubes are mechanical and efficient and requires no welding.",
        "4": "The connector itself a spherical steel ball. The tubes are mounted by bolts at each ends and fastened to the spherical steel ball connector element.",
        "5": "Al the elements are produced either galvanized or painted Space frame structural system offers numerous benefits including light weight, low foundation cost, cost efficiency, less construction time, error free Construction and ease of assembly.",
        "6": "Individual pieces are easy to handle and can be assembled quickly with-necessary Supervision with non-specialized workers.",
        "7": "Space frame Can be designed in different profiles (flat, circular, elliptical parabolic or a compound of different curves) in order to comply with required clearances or maximize the covered area"
